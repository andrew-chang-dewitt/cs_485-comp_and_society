## objectives

1. know the basics of the history of computing
2. understand the role & importance of ethics in the profession
3. relate current events in technology & impact on society
4. understand possible future complexities

objectives number 2 & 3 are where we will spend most of our time.

## motivations

technology exists in an environment & is created by people w/ their own
ideas/flaws; as such technology can propagate mistakes/biases/etc. into
its environment (society) & alter it in unpredicted ways.

prepares us for the impact of our work/studies in the future; helps us
to ask why we should do (or not do) something & who it might effect.
additionally, teaches us how to see effects in the reverse (i.e. how
society impacts technology).

## overview

we'll cover the following topics (in order)

1. history (100 years)
2. privacy
3. freedom of speech
4. intellectual property
5. cybercrime
6. technology & work
7. failures & risk
8. biases & fairness in AI
9. computing ethics & responsibilities
10. computing & climate
11. AI & art

## administrivia

### materials:

- _A Gift of Fire_, by Sara Baase
- additional readings as needed, provided on Canvas

### grading

standard 10% scale (90%+ is A & so on) w/ the following category weights:

- _**20% assignments**_

  5 assignments posted & submitted on Canvas

- _**20% class discussions**_

  about 8 to 10 classes will be devoted to discussion of a topic (after
  the lecture material for the topic is covered). discussions will have
  some questions provided & each student will be expected to speak for
  2 to 3 minutes.

- _**20% final report**_
- _**20% midterm exam**_

- _**20% final exam**_

  both exams will be open-book & take-home (administered on Canvas)

### final report

final report will be composed of two, equally-weighted parts:

1. a research paper on a topic related to the course (list of topics is provided). report should be about 5 pages long **use Times New Roman font in 12 point size & single-spaced**.
2. a presentation of the paper. it must be about 20 slides long & be accompanied w/ a 10-15 minute video presenting the materials.

as the report is intended to take all semester, it is recommended to start early. be sure to use ideas covered in class & relate them to the chosen topic. some questions given by the prof that we should try to answer:

> - what is the background/history of the topic?
> - what has changed in society because of this topic?
> - has this change been good or bad for society?
> - how & who were impacted by these changes?
> - how will this topic look 10 years from now?
> - what problems do you think will arise and how to mitigate them?
> - what sources were used?

if we want to choose a topic not on the list, just discuss it with prof before getting started.

### writing guidelines

is is important to keep writing style uniform. to that end the following guidelines are to be adhered to:

- all submissions should be made as pdf on Canvas
- use Times New Roman font, size 12 point, single-spaced
- always cite sources (inline & w/ references at end)

### late policy

5 late days to use throughout the semester. usage of these days means no penalties; however, once all days are used then late submissions will be given a 0.

### academic integrity

in addition to typical university policies, the following were mentioned:

- all work is individual in this course; submissions will be reviewed by Turnitin for plagarism
- generative AI is allowed to some extent, but must be kept to 20% or less of the work & must be explicitely mentioned in the submission
